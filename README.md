My bot for Russian AI Cup 2018: CodeBall

### ATTENTION
The code in this repository is ugly. Even I hardly understand it. 
It was developed in a big rush, with a plenty of fast modifications. Many of those would normally require
refactoring, which has never happened.

It should not be viewed by anyone.

I warned you.
